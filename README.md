# OTA
Universal OverTheAir firmware update system for esp-open-rtos based GitHub repositories

With release 0.3.0 this repository has finally migrated to [LCM](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/life-cycle-manager)

If you are an early adopter
Version 0.3.0 will make the switch over automatically once you trigger an OTA update  
You can monitor LCM using the terminal command on a mac on the same Wifi network as your device
