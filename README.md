# OTA
Universal OverTheAir firmware update system for esp-open-rtos based GitHub repositories

## Design
This is a repository in the making. It starts with a good design so I started with the flowchart.

![](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/ota/blob/master/design-v1.png)

### Concepts
```
boot=slot1
baseURL=repo
version=x
```
This represents that in sector1 used by rboot, we will also store the following info
- baseURL: everything is intended to be relative to https://github.com, so this info is the user/repo part
- version: the version that this repo is currently running at

After this we run the OTA code which will try to deposit in boot slot 0 the latest version of the baseURL repo.

```
t
```
This represents an exponential hold-off to prevent excesive hammering on the github servers. It resets at a power-cycle.

```
download certificate signature
certificate update?
Download Certificates
```
This is a file that contains the checksum of the sector containing three certificates/keys
- public key of HomeACessoryKid that signs the certificate/key sector 
- root CA used by GitHub
- root CA used by the DistributedContentProvider (Amazon for now)

First, the file is intended to be downloaded with server certificate verification activated. If this fails, it is downloaded anyway without verification and server is marked as invalid. Once downloaded, the sha256 checksum of the active sector is compared to the checksum in the signature file. If equal, we move on. If not, we download the updated sector file to the standby sector.

```
signature match?
```
From the sector containing up to date certificates the sha256 hash is signed by the private key of HomeACessoryKid.
Using the available public key, the validity is verified

```
server valid?
```
If in the previous steps the server is marked invalid, we return to the main app in boot slot 0 and we report by syslog to a server (to be determinded) so we learn that github has changed its certificate CA provider and HomeACessoryKid can issue a new certificate sector.

```
new OTA version?
self-updater(0) update OTAapp➔1
checksum OK?
```
Now that the downloading from GitHub has been secured, we can trust whatever we download based on a checksum.
We verify if there is an update of this OTA repo itself? If so, we use a self-updater (part of this repo) to 'self update'. After this we have the latest OTA code.

```
OTA app(1) updates Main app➔0
checksum OK?
```
Using the baseURL info and the version as stored in sector1, the latest binary is found and downloaded if needed. If the checksum does not work out, we return to the OTA app start point considering we cannot run the old code anymore.
But normally we boot the new code and the mission is done.

Note that switching from boot=slot1 to boot=slot0 does not require a reflash

## Providing the images
The intention is that the image that needs to be flashed will be available in a GitHub offical release using Travis.
This implies two things:
- there is an actual version number to work with and an unique entry-point 'latest'
- Github and Travis take care that the process is 100% documented so full code review can take place at all times to keep everyone honest

For the moment have a look at a sample of this idea at [FOTA-test](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/FOTAtest/releases)

## Improvements
I will use the [issues section](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/ota/issues) for all to feed back your ideas. I have one issue myself already...
